==OVERVIEW
"Yeah! Another Backup Utility" (Yabu in short) is a backup and recovery utility for linux.
It maybe works for other systems but I don't know.

==INSTALL
Put all the files somewhere in your PATH.

==BEFORE RUNNING
Yabu is in it's development stage. Try it, hack it, learn from
it, but DON'T USE IT right now in a production environment.
To try Yabu, just edit directories.conf and yabu.conf.
But you really should check the user's guide before...

==RUNNING
Type yabu.rb from a terminal to start saving your data.
Type yabu.rb --help to view a list of options.
Recovery is not yet implemented.

==HACKING
Begin by reading the Yabu class.
